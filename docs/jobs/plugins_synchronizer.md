# Plugins synchronizer

This job synchronize plugins between those stored locally (typically downloaded by the Plugins Downloader job) and the installed plugins.

----

## Use it

Sample job configuration in your scenario file:

```yaml
  - name: Synchronize plugins
    uses: qplugins-synchronizer
    with:
      profile_ref: downloaded
```

----

## Options

### action

> [!WARNING]
> Deprecated since 0.48: this option has no effect and will be removed in QDT 0.50. Using it logs a deprecation warning. Remove it from your scenarios.
> To remove plugins no longer listed in profiles, use the [Cleanup manager job](./cleanup_manager.md) with the `plugins_installed` scope, after this job.

Possible_values: `create`, `create_or_restore`, `remove`.

### deletion_policy

[Deletion policy](../usage/settings.md#deletion-policy) to apply when it comes to removing files from the end-user disk.

Possible_values: see [Deletion policy](../usage/settings.md#deletion-policy) section in configuration page.

Default: `trash_or_delete`

> [!WARNING]
> This option was named `deletion_mode` until QDT 0.45. The old name is still accepted as a deprecated alias, logging a warning, and will be removed in a future version.

### profile_ref

Which `profile.json` file to use as reference.

Possible_values:

- `downloaded`: read plugins from the profiles downloaded by the running scenario (`repositories/<scenario id>` in the QDT working folder) before they are copied in to the user QGIS data. Profiles downloaded by other scenarios are ignored.
- `installed`: read plugins from the installed profiles (folders in user data QGIS3). Useful when using a scenario without the `qprofiles-manager` job. Be careful: if the end-user edits the profile.json file located directly into the QGIS profile folder to control the plugins synchronization.

Default: `~/.cache/qgis-deployment-toolbelt/plugins`

### source

Where to find plugins zip files.

Possible_values: a valid path to an existing folder

Default: `~/.cache/qgis-deployment-toolbelt/plugins`

----

## How does it work

### Workflow

1. List plugins archives into the source folder. Default: `~/.cache/qgis-deployment-toolbelt/plugins`
1. Parse profiles installed
1. Compare plugin versions between referenced in profile.json and the one installed
1. If version plugin in installed profile is inferior, unzip the download plugin in installed profiles. Upgrade process can be controlled per plugin in `profile.json` using [`upgrade_mode`](../reference/qdt_profile.md#upgrade_mode):
   - `keep` (default): existing plugin folder is kept, newer version is unpacked on top of it,
   - `delete`: existing plugin folder is deleted before unpack.

### QDT-managed plugins manifest

> Added in version 0.44.0

Every plugin installed or upgraded by this job is recorded in a `.qdt-managed-plugins.json` file, stored directly under the profile's `python/plugins` folder (next to the plugin folders themselves). For each plugin, it keeps its version, its plugin ID (when known), the QDT version that deployed it and the installation date.

This manifest lets QDT keep track of which plugins it actually deployed, as opposed to plugins installed manually by the end-user within the same profile (for example, through QGIS' own Plugin Manager). It's meant to be internally read by QDT and shouldn't be edited manually.
