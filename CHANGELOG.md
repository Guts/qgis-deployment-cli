## 0.48.0 - 2026-10-23

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Security fix: all previous versions are affected.**
> This release updates the CA certificates bundle ([certifi](https://pypi.org/project/certifi/) >= 2026.10.19) to drop the emSign root certificates compromised in the [eMudhra incident](https://discuss.python.org/t/information-for-python-users-regarding-emudhra-emsign-ca-certificate-security-incident/109576). Earlier versions are exposed to man-in-the-middle attacks on HTTPS downloads (scenarios, profiles, plugins, upgrade). See the advisory [GHSA-g43m-g8h7-cjcp](https://github.com/qgis-deployment/qgis-deployment-toolbelt-cli/security/advisories/GHSA-g43m-g8h7-cjcp) for details and workarounds.
>
> Download this version from the release page rather than with `qdt upgrade` from a previous version.
